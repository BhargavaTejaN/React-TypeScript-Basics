TypeScript is a programming language that is a superset of JavaScript developed and maintained by Microsoft,
it includes all of JavaScript's features and adds additional functionality. 

TypeScript provides static typing, which allows developers to catch errors before runtime, 
making it easier to maintain and scale large codebases. 

It also includes features such as classes, interfaces, and modules, which make it easier to write and organize code. 
TypeScript is widely used in web development, especially in Angular projects.

In short, TypeScript is a powerful tool for developing large-scale applications, 
improving code maintainability and catching errors earlier in the development process.
